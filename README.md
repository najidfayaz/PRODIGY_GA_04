# PRODIGY_GA_04
Image-to-Image Translation with cGAN (pix2pix)

Task Overview
This project is part of the Generative AI Internship at **Prodigy Infotech**.
The objective of Task-04 is to implement an image-to-image translation model using a conditional GAN (pix2pix).

---

Model Used
- pix2pix (cGAN)
- PyTorch implementation

---

Dataset
- edges2shoes dataset (paired images)
- Input: Edge images
- Output: Realistic shoe images

---

Implementation
- Google Colab with GPU support
- Short training for demonstration
- Image-to-image translation using pix2pix

---

How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab
2. Enable GPU
3. Run all cells sequentially
4. View generated images in results folder

---

Output
The model successfully translates input images into corresponding target images.

---

Result
The pix2pix cGAN demonstrates effective image-to-image translation using paired datasets.
